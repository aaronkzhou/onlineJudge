/*
Given an array A of N integers, we draw N discs in a 2D plane such that
the I-th disc is centered on (0,I) and has a radius of A[I].
We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and J-th and K-th discs
have at least one common point.

Write a function:

    function solution($A);

that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above,
returns the number of pairs of intersecting discs. For example, given N=6 and:

    A[0] = 1  A[1] = 5  A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 1  A[4] = 4  A[5] = 0

intersecting discs appear in eleven pairs of elements:

        0 and 1,
        0 and 2,
        0 and 4,
        1 and 2,
        1 and 3,
        1 and 4,
        1 and 5,
        2 and 3,
        2 and 4,
        3 and 4,
        4 and 5.

so the function should return 11.

The function should return −1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

Assume that:
        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2147483647].

Complexity:
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N),
        beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
