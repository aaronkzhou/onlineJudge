1. agile methodology
build empty test and make the test failed--> complete development--> make the test passed
2. scrum
1.make product owner, scrum master, scrum team to deliver our product.

steve jobs
1. not a money chaser.
2. create epoch-making product
3. build the ecosystem of IOS/MACOS
4. change style of living
1. a automatic excel tool to help my teacher merge data from multiple file to only 1 file when I was 18.

Phonenumber: Customerid, phonenumbers
pets: Customerid, PetsID

("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE EmailAddress = '".$userEmailAddress."'"); //wrong
(’SELECT * FROM Users WHERE EmailAddress = "$userEmailAddress"‘)//right

1. Because scripts are in one location, updates and tracking of dependencies based on schema changes becomes easier
2. Can be tested independent of the application
3. The power of SQL is its ability to quickly and efficiently perform set-based processing on large amounts of data; the coding equivalent is usually iterative looping, which is generally much slower
4. Provide an "interface" to the underlying data structure so that all implementation and even the data itself is shielded.

1. when the query is simple and we need to make it more readable, we use subqueries.
2. if the query is complex and we need to make it faster, we use Joins.

$str = "0d52"
if ("0d52"==0){
echo "true";//will out put true instead of false, because we use "==" instead of "===" which let "0d52" change to int
}else{
echo "false";
}
1111
echo '1';
echo '1'.'11';

just like picking toys from toys pool.
we try to pick up 5 times but only get 4 toys which make our extra 1 pickup look like redundant.

1. dump the sql query in php file.
2. check the log in mysql log or php/framework log.
3. use unit test to check if the parameter has been updated.
